## DC Motor Controlling with ATmega328

# INTRODUCTION :
This activity is demonstration of controlling DC motor with the help of Atmega328 microcontroller.

In this activity, 
I performed two operations with DC motor
1) Controlling DC motor using in clockwise direction using switch.
2) Controlling DC motor direction( clockwise & anticlockwise ) using switch.

DC MOTOR: 
A direct current (DC) motor is a type of electric machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. DC motors take electrical power through direct current, and convert this energy into mechanical rotation.
DC motors use magnetic fields that occur from the electrical currents generated, which powers the movement of a rotor fixed within the output shaft. The output torque and speed depends upon both the electrical input and the design of the motor.

Atmega 328:
The high-performance Microchip 8-bit AVR® RISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISP Flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, three flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented Two-Wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8-channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, and five software selectable power saving modes. The device operates between 1.8-5.5 volts.


## SWOT Analysis
